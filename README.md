# Pandas-Challenge
<b>Using Pandas to analyze the data for an independent gaming company's latest release: Heroes of Pymoli.</b><br>
I was able to analyze and create a report with the following:
1. Total number of players.
2. Purchasing Analysis which shows the average number as well as the total number of purchases, and total revenue.
3. Gender demographics as well as purchasing analysis based on gender.
4. Age Demographics.
5. Top spending users as well as the most profitable items.
