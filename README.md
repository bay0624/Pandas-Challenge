# Pandas-Challenge
<b>Using Pandas to analyze the data for an independent gaming company's latest release: Heroes of Pymoli.</b><br>
I was able to analyze and create a report with the following:
1. Total number of players.
2. Purchasing Analysis which shows the average number as well as the total number of purchases, and total revenue.
3. Gender demographics as well as purchasing analysis based on gender.
4. Age Demographics.
5. Top spending players as well as the most profitable items.

<h3>The 3 Observable Trends based on the Data:</h3>
1. The most obvious one is the huge disparity between the number of male and female gamers. The ratio is almost 6:1 in favor of males. This data shows that Heros of Pymoli is clearly favored more by males. So maybe the company should consider changing their marketing strategy to attract more female gamers.
2. The age group with the highest number of players as well as purchases is 20 to 24.
3. The most popular item is "Final Critic" with 13 purchases and a total revenue of $63.44.
